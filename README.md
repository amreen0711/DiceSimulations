# Dice Simulations – Exercises 2.12, 2.20, and 2.21

This project contains R code to simulate different types of dice and calculate probabilities for specific outcomes.  
All simulations are done with 10,000 trials.

## Files and Folders
- **R/exercises.R** – Main R script for all exercises.
- **outputs/dice_regular.png** – Bar chart for two regular dice.
- **outputs/dice_trick.png** – Bar chart for trick dice.
- **outputs/dice_sicherman.png** – Bar chart for Sicherman dice.
- **outputs/results.csv** – Probabilities from Exercises 2.20 and 2.21.

## How to Run
1. Open `R/exercises.R` in RStudio.
2. Set the working directory to the project folder.
3. Click **Source** to run all simulations.
4. Plots will appear in RStudio and be saved to the `outputs/` folder.
